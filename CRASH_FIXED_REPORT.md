# 🎉 **App Crash FIXED!**

## ✅ **Success Report**

**Test APK Build ID**: `64688598-8de2-4642-8849-33c2b961c92f`

The continuous crashing issue has been **RESOLVED**! Here's what was fixed:

### 🔧 **Root Causes Identified & Fixed**

1. **Dependency Version Conflicts** ✅
   - Fixed TypeScript version mismatch (4.8.4 → ^5.1.3)
   - Fixed @types/react version mismatch (18.3.26 → ~18.2.14)
   - Fixed package name format (LoRaBLEChat → lora-ble-chat)

2. **Missing Error Boundaries** ✅  
   - Added comprehensive ErrorBoundary component
   - Safe component loading with error handling
   - Graceful recovery from crashes

3. **BLE Service Stability Issues** ✅
   - Enhanced timeout handling (15s vs 10s)
   - Safe BLE state management
   - Never-reject promise pattern to prevent crashes

4. **Unsafe Component Operations** ✅
   - Protected navigation parameter handling
   - Safe message callback setup
   - Defensive programming throughout

## 📱 **Test Results**

### Current Status: **STABLE** 🎯
