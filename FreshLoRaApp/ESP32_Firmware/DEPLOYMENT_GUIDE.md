## üß™ COMPREHENSIVE TESTING PROTOCOL

### Phase 1: Hardware Verification ‚úÖ
```bash
# ESP32 M1 Station
‚ñ° Power on - LED should light up
‚ñ° Serial monitor shows initialization messages
‚ñ° "‚úÖ LoRa module initialized successfully"
‚ñ° "‚úÖ BLE server ready - advertising as: M1_xxxxxx"
‚ñ° No error messages in serial output

# ESP32 M2 Station  
‚ñ° Power on - LED should light up
‚ñ° Serial monitor shows initialization messages
‚ñ° "‚úÖ LoRa module initialized successfully"
‚ñ° "‚úÖ BLE server ready - advertising as: M2_xxxxxx"
‚ñ° No error messages in serial output
```

### Phase 2: BLE Connectivity Testing ‚úÖ
```bash
# Phone A ‚Üí M1 Station
‚ñ° Open React Native app
‚ñ° Tap "Find LoRa Stations"
‚ñ° M1 station appears in scan results
‚ñ° Tap "Connect" on M1 station
‚ñ° Connection successful
‚ñ° Chat screen opens with welcome message
‚ñ° ESP32 M1 serial shows: "üì± Phone connected via BLE"

# Phone B ‚Üí M2 Station
‚ñ° Repeat above steps for M2 station
‚ñ° Both phones should be connected to their respective stations
```

### Phase 3: LoRa Communication Testing ‚úÖ
```bash
# Direct LoRa Test (ESP32 to ESP32)
‚ñ° Place M1 and M2 stations 1-2 meters apart
‚ñ° Monitor serial output on both stations
‚ñ° Send test message from Phone A
‚ñ° M1 serial should show: "üì° Sending LoRa packet"
‚ñ° M2 serial should show: "üì° Received LoRa packet"
‚ñ° Check RSSI and SNR values in serial output
```

### Phase 4: End-to-End Messaging ‚úÖ
```bash
# Phone A ‚Üí M1 ‚Üí LoRa ‚Üí M2 ‚Üí Phone B
‚ñ° Send message "Hello from Phone A" on Phone A
‚ñ° Message should appear on Phone B
‚ñ° Check timestamps match approximately
‚ñ° Verify sender shows as "remote"
‚ñ° Check signal quality indicators

# Phone B ‚Üí M2 ‚Üí LoRa ‚Üí M1 ‚Üí Phone A  
‚ñ° Send reply "Hello from Phone B" on Phone B
‚ñ° Message should appear on Phone A
‚ñ° Verify bidirectional communication works
‚ñ° Check message order is preserved
```

### Phase 5: Range Testing üîç
```bash
# Progressive Distance Testing
‚ñ° Test at 10m: Should work perfectly
‚ñ° Test at 100m: Should work with good signal
‚ñ° Test at 500m: Should work with moderate signal
‚ñ° Test at 1km: Should work with weak signal
‚ñ° Test at 2km+: Test maximum range
‚ñ° Note RSSI/SNR values at each distance
```

### Phase 6: Stress Testing ‚ö°
```bash
# Rapid Messaging
‚ñ° Send 10 messages quickly from Phone A
‚ñ° All messages should arrive at Phone B
‚ñ° Check for message loss or corruption
‚ñ° Monitor ESP32 memory usage

# Connection Stability
‚ñ° Disconnect and reconnect BLE multiple times
‚ñ° Test recovery after power cycle
‚ñ° Test behavior when one station is powered off
‚ñ° Test with weak LoRa signals
```

## üîß TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

### ‚ùå BLE Connection Issues
```bash
Problem: ESP32 not appearing in scan
Solutions:
‚ñ° Check BLE advertising is started
‚ñ° Verify device name in serial output
‚ñ° Restart app and try again
‚ñ° Check Android permissions (Location + Bluetooth)
‚ñ° Try different Android device

Problem: Connection fails
Solutions:
‚ñ° Check ESP32 is not connected to another device
‚ñ° Restart ESP32 and try again
‚ñ° Check serial output for error messages
‚ñ° Verify BLE characteristic UUIDs match
```

### üì° LoRa Communication Issues
```bash
Problem: Messages not reaching remote station
Solutions:
‚ñ° Check both stations use same frequency/settings
‚ñ° Verify antennas are properly connected
‚ñ° Check for LoRa initialization errors
‚ñ° Test with stations closer together
‚ñ° Monitor serial output for transmission confirmations

Problem: Poor signal quality
Solutions:
‚ñ° Check antenna connections and positioning
‚ñ° Increase TX power (max 20dBm in EU)
‚ñ° Reduce distance between stations
‚ñ° Check for interference sources
‚ñ° Try different LoRa settings (SF8 for better sensitivity)
```

### üîÑ Message Flow Issues
```bash
Problem: Messages sent but not received on phone
Solutions:
‚ñ° Check BLE connection is active
‚ñ° Verify JSON message format
‚ñ° Check serial output for parsing errors
‚ñ° Restart phone app
‚ñ° Check phone's Bluetooth connection

Problem: One-way communication only
Solutions:
‚ñ° Check both ESP32 stations are properly configured
‚ñ° Verify station types (M1 vs M2) are different
‚ñ° Check LoRa settings match on both stations
‚ñ° Test each direction individually
```
